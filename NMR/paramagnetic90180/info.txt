We are using t_90 as 13, freq 7.5165 MHz
And adjusted capacitance accordingly.


We are gonna measure T2 for a variety of ferric chloride ration
Vary tau, measure spin echo amplitude. Which we use to measure T2 via 90 180

Each file is save as a csv with 5 amplitudes. The name is the number of solution used

Systematic variance is 0.4 mV

The samples are all from Feb 2023:
number 6
