We are using t_90 as 15, freq 7.505 MHz
And adjusted capacitance accordingly.

We are gonna measure T2 for a variety of glycerin to water ratio
Vary tau, measure spin echo amplitude. Which we use to measure T2.

Each file is save as a csv with 5 amplitudes. 

Systematic variance is 0.4 mV

The samples are:
80+- 0.39% glycerin
60 +- 0.01% glycerin
40 +- 0.06% glycerin
20 +- 0.07% glycerin
