We are using t_90 as 21, freq 7.505 MHz
And adjusted capacitance accordingly.


We are gonna measure T1 for a variety of ferric chloride ration
Vary tau, measure spin echo amplitude. Which we use to measure T1 using 3 pulse sequence

Each file is save as a csv with 5 amplitudes. The name is the number of solution used

Systematic variance is 0.4 mV

The samples are all from Feb 2023:
number 5
number 7
